# Production launch runbook

Status: active  
Application: sdkwork-knowledgebase  
Topology: `cloud.production`<br>
Updated: 2026-07-23

## Purpose

Operational checklist for launching SDKWork Knowledgebase in a tenant-scoped production deployment. Run this only after the current repository verification and release-evidence gates pass locally and in CI.

## Pre-flight

1. Confirm secrets are provisioned outside topology files:
   - Database password (`SDKWORK_CLAW_DATABASE_PASSWORD_FILE`)
   - Secrets encryption key (`SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`)
   - Outbox webhook URL and signing secret
   - Drive Internal API ingress token (`sdkwork-knowledgebase-drive-internal-api/ingress-token`)
   - Drive event signing master secret (`sdkwork-knowledgebase-drive-events/current`)
   - Database-backed Snowflake node lease identity for every ingress/worker replica
   - No static `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SNOWFLAKE_NODE_ID` unless an emergency change record explicitly enables the override
   - A dedicated tenant-local service actor matching `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_WORKER_WIKI_ACTOR_ID`; it must not be a human administrator account
2. Apply topology from `etc/topology/cloud.production.env`.
3. Ensure public ingress exposes the app/backend/open paths and the single protected Drive callback at `/internal/v3/api/knowledgebase/drive_events`. The callback requires both application ingress authentication and the Drive signature contract and must not be re-exported by `platform.api-gateway`. **Do not expose `/metrics` on ingress**; Prometheus scrapes in-cluster via ServiceMonitor.
4. Run repository gates:
   ```bash
   pnpm verify
   pnpm test:launch-readiness
   pnpm lint
   ```

## Database bootstrap

1. Point `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_DATABASE_URL` at the production PostgreSQL instance.
2. Bootstrap and validate:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:bootstrap
   pnpm db:validate
   pnpm db:drift:check
   ```
3. Record migration status output in the change ticket.

## Deployment smoke

1. Deploy Kubernetes manifests from `deployments/kubernetes/`.
2. Verify health on each API surface:
   ```bash
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://knowledgebase.example.com pnpm test:smoke
   ```
   Public smoke checks only probe `/livez` and `/readyz`; `/metrics` remains in-cluster only.
   Probe the application public ingress and worker independently; app/backend/open URLs are logical route authorities on the same ingress:
   ```bash
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_APP_URL=https://knowledgebase.example.com \
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_BACKEND_URL=https://knowledgebase-admin.example.com \
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_OPEN_URL=https://knowledge.example.com \
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_WORKER_URL=https://knowledgebase-worker.example.com \
   pnpm test:smoke
   ```
3. Optional internal metrics smoke, run only from an in-cluster network path:
   ```bash
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_METRICS_URLS=http://sdkwork-knowledgebase-app-api,http://sdkwork-knowledgebase-worker:18085 \
   pnpm test:smoke
   ```
4. Optional authenticated admin probe:
   ```bash
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_BACKEND_URL=https://knowledgebase-admin.example.com \
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... \
   pnpm test:launch-readiness
   ```
5. Optional integrator open API probe:
   ```bash
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_OPEN_URL=https://knowledge.example.com \
   SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_SMOKE_API_KEY=... \
   pnpm test:launch-readiness
   ```
6. Confirm worker `/readyz` returns 200, queued ingestion jobs drain, and Wiki source counters do
   not show a growing retry/quarantine backlog after a test ingest.

## Drive event delivery and signing-secret rotation

Normal operation mounts only `/run/secrets/sdkwork/drive-event-signing/current`. The optional
`previous` key and `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_DRIVE_EVENT_PREVIOUS_SIGNING_SECRET_FILE` exist only
during a controlled overlap. Manage secret values through the approved secret manager or GitOps
workflow; do not place them in shell history, manifests, tickets, or logs.

1. Record the active Wiki checkpoint count for the tenant and calculate the renewal pages as
   `ceil(active_checkpoint_count / renewal_page_size)`. Use a page size no greater than 200.
2. Atomically publish `current = new secret` and `previous = old secret` in
   `sdkwork-knowledgebase-drive-events`.
3. Set `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_DRIVE_EVENT_PREVIOUS_SIGNING_SECRET_FILE` to
   `/run/secrets/sdkwork/drive-event-signing/previous` on both the app API and worker Deployments,
   then perform a rolling restart. The app API now verifies events signed from either master;
   the worker derives all new channel tokens from `current`.
4. Temporarily set
   `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_WORKER_WIKI_EVENT_DELIVERY_RENEWAL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60` and
   `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_WORKER_WIKI_EVENT_DELIVERY_RENEWAL_PAGE_SIZE=200`, if the normal values
   would not complete every renewal page inside the change window. Roll the worker once so the
   first bounded renewal starts immediately.
5. Observe at least the calculated number of successful renewal pages. Treat every structured
   `knowledgebase.wiki.drive_event_delivery_renewal_failed` event as a failed rotation gate; its
   `checkpoint_id`, `source_scope_uuid`, and stable `error_code` identify the retry target.
6. Restore the normal renewal interval/page size and wait for the greater of the operational
   webhook retry window and one complete Drive outbox retry cycle. Drive currently performs at
   most 10 delivery attempts; use the deployed Drive dispatch interval when calculating the
   window, with additional rollout and queue-drain margin.
7. Remove `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_DRIVE_EVENT_PREVIOUS_SIGNING_SECRET_FILE` from both Deployments,
   roll the app API and worker, then remove the `previous` Secret key. A missing file must never be
   referenced by the environment.
8. Upload a Markdown file under a Wiki `sources/raw` root and verify: Drive outbox status is
   delivered, the Knowledgebase inbox event is applied, its checkpoint advances, the source moves
   `DISCOVERED -> PROCESSING -> READY`, and an auto-public Wiki moves the page to `PUBLISHED`.
   Resolve the public route and verify the response is sanitized `text/html; charset=utf-8` pinned
   to the uploaded Drive version. Delete the same file and verify the public route is revoked
   immediately. Neither operation may create a Deploy Release, Deployment, or SiteRevision.

Rollback before step 7 by restoring the old secret as `current`, retaining the new value as
`previous`, rolling both Deployments, and renewing all pages again. After step 7, use the same
two-secret overlap procedure; never perform an uncoordinated single-secret rollback.

## Observability

1. Set `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_LOG_FORMAT=json` in production topology for structured log aggregation.
2. When an OTLP collector is available, set:
   - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
   - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` per process (`sdkwork-knowledgebase-public-ingress`, `sdkwork-knowledgebase-worker`)
3. Confirm ServiceMonitor targets scrape `/metrics` in-cluster and dashboards include:
   - `knowledgebase_health_status`
   - `knowledge_api_requests_total`
   - `knowledge_api_auth_failures_total`

## Release artifacts

1. Keep the browser bundle package (`web-universal-cloud-browser-zip`) disabled while its manifest
   package metadata remains `releaseStatus: prelaunch-artifact-pending`.
2. Do not publish or enable `web-universal-cloud-browser-zip` until release evidence has been
   recorded for checksum, signature, SBOM, provenance, attestation, workflow run, rollout,
   rollback, and live smoke results per `sdkwork.app.config.json`.
3. Publish or approve private-registry consumption for all three SDK families:
   - `sdkwork-knowledgebase-app-sdk`
   - `sdkwork-knowledgebase-backend-sdk`
   - `sdkwork-knowledgebase-sdk`
4. Keep desktop bundles disabled until desktop CI packaging targets ship (`releaseStatus: prelaunch-disabled`).
5. Run Playwright launch flows in CI:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e:playwright
   ```

## Backup drill

Before traffic cutover, exercise `deployments/runbooks/backup-restore.md` in staging:

1. Take a logical PostgreSQL dump.
2. Restore to an isolated database.
3. Re-run `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:status`, and `/readyz` checks.

## Rollback

1. Roll back Deployments to the previous image tag.
2. Restore database only when schema drift requires it; otherwise prefer forward-fix migrations.
3. Disable ingress traffic and verify `/readyz` on the rolled-back revision before re-enabling traffic.
